- There are 2 parts to a convolution layer:
    - **Kernal**: The convolution matrix that we use to multiply.
    - **Feature Map**: Result of the feature extraction that we wokred on.


We use this to extract features of the matrix

## There are 2 types of convolution: 
- VALID: without padding
- SAME: 0 padding
