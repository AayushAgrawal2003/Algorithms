# Image Segmentation

// Outputs a collection of regions 

- Semantic Segmentation 
	- We assign a label to every pizel in the image, for eg car, human, etc 

- Instance Segmentation 
	- We want to assign values to instances even though they might have the same class
	- human 1 and human 2 
- Panoptic Segmentation
	- Every pixel is given a class and an instance as well
	- A pixel can belong to just a class and some pixels can be given a clas and instance 
	- sky, human(human 1, human 2)
