## What is a GAN 
Generative adversarial networks
### Elements of a GAN
- Generator Model: Used to generate images
- Discriminator Model: Used to classify images into real and fake

- The Geeretor model takes an input vector z as an input and generates the images G(z)
- These images then get sent to the Discriminator Model to be classifed fake or real  
- Then we measure the loss and this loss is backpropogated through the network to update the weights 
- When we are training the Discriminator, we have to freeze the Generator and back propagate errors to only update the Discriminator.
-  Both models are improved after each epoch. To stop training we use a concept called Nash Equillibrium, When we can say all generated images look simmilar to the orignal.

### Introducings constants to understand loss

- G	Generator Model
- D	Discriminator Model
- z	Random Noise (Fixed size input vector)
- x	Real Image
- G(z)	Image generated by Generator (Fake Image)
- pdata(x)	Probability Distribution of Real Images
- pz(z)	Probability Distribution of Fake Images
- D(G(z))	Discriminator’s output when the generated image is an input
- D(x)	Discriminator’s output when the real image is an input

### Matchematical equation for the loss function

Generator wants to minimize V(D,G) and Discriminator wants to maximize V(D,G)


- Ex~pdata(x) [log D(x)]: Average log probability of D when real image is input.
- Ez~pz(z) [log(1 – D(G(z)))]: Average log probability of D when the generated image is input.


-> Latent and observable variables

Latent variables cant be referenced directly


### Training the Generator 

- Take a random data sample $x$ from out training dataset, as real data

- Data from the generator $x'$ data but labelled as fake.


### Training the Discriminator 

- Take a random noise vector $z$ as an input and generate a fake sample $x'$ using the Generator Network
